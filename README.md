## ERD


### R7:	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

  Problem: Makers have limited access to 3d printers unless they own one

### R8:	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

  - currently, makers have to rely on educational facilities (only available to them if they are a student), friends/family that own a printer, or local libraries that may have a long wait time.

  - 3d printers are incredibly versatile and by making them more accessible to people, they can be used to solve a plethora of problems.

  - remove a limitation for a person who may potentially result in an impactful creation

### R11:	Description of your marketplace app (website), including:
